# LA-Hacks

FOR TEAMMATES: 


Setting up the project on your computer:

* Make a new folder
* follow steps in link below to install nvm, Node.js and npm (I didn't do the other stuff yet but y'all can)
  *  https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/docs/setup
* Once you have that down clone my project from this GitHub



Structure of Project:

* HTML files are in folder "views" and end in .ejs (which stands for embedded java-script, can write as if html)
  * don't worry about the first and last lines in both .ejs files, just put your html in between them
* CSS file (main.css) is in folder public->stylesheets
  * Can use normal CSS
* I already included bootstrap which will make the front-end of the project easier - but styling should prolly be one of the last thigns we do
  * docs: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/alerts/
* app.js is kind of backbone of the application -- has all the routes and stuff. You shouldn't have to worry about that yet?
  * instructions of how to run in there tho
* DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE OTHER STUFF
  


Running the Project

* in terminal (or wtv Windows has) ...
    * make sure you're in the same directory as your project (this is why made a new folder)
    * use command "node app.js"
      * terminal should output "LA Hacks Running"
    * then go to http://localhost:3000 (this is temporary) to view the webpage
    * to stop the running application, in terminal use: ctrl + c
    
    
GOOD LUCK <3
